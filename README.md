=========

(Use C/C++/Java/Python)

# Exercise 1
1. Create a data file to store records of the students 
    (fields: rollno, name, branch,age).
1. Sort the records of the file based on the ```rollno``` of the students.
1. Perform external sorting procedure (based on the roll number) on two data files
which store records of the students and store the result in to the third data file.
1. Store student records (fields: rollno, name, branch, age) in a data file and perform
linear search in the data file by reading ```rollno``` as input and then display the student
details and display the time required to do this operation.

# Exercise 2
Store student records (fields: rollno,name,branch,age) in a data file and build an index
file by considering the rollno as the key.
1. Perform linear search in the index file by reading rollno as input and then display
the student details by reading from the data file and display the time required to
do this operation.
1. Perform binary search in the index file (by sorting the index file based on the
rollno) by reading rollno as input and then display the student details by reading
from the data file and display the time required to do this operation.

# Exercise 3
Store student records (fields: rollno, name, branch, age) in a data file and build an index
file by using binary search tree ( rollno is used as the key).
1. Perform search in the index file by reading rollno as input and then display the
student details by reading from the data file and display the time required to do
this operation.
1. Add and delete the student records from the data file and then perform
corresponding modifications in the index file.

# Exercise 4
Store student records (fields: rollno, name, branch, age) in a data file and build an index file by using hash table (```rollno``` is used as the key here).

1. Perform search in the index file by reading rollno as input and then display the
student details by reading from the data file and display the time required to do this
operation.
1. Add and delete the student records from the data file and then perform
corresponding modifications in the index file.

# Exercise 5
Store student records (fields: rollno, name, branch,age) in a data file and build an index file
by using B+ tree (rollno is used as the key here).
1. Perform search in the index file by reading rollno as input and then display the
student details by reading from the data file and display the time required to do this
operation.
1. Add and delete the student records from the data file and then perform corresponding modifications in the index file.

# Exercise 6
Develop module(s) for creating tables by fixing the number of columns (fields), individual
column names and their data types and store the schema in the catalog (data dictionary).

Consider one column as the primary key and create index file for the same. 

Also, develop the
module for dropping a table along with the index file and for modifying the table by adding/dropping columns.
